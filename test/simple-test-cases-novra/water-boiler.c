/* This program reads a sequence of pressure values in the circuit of a
 * water boiler, measured at regular intervals. The sequence is terminated by
 * the first negative number.
 *   The output of the program is the average of the various pressure values and
 * the average of the pressure peaks.
 *   A pressure value p1 is a peak (or local maxima) if it is followed by another
 * value p2 which is lesser than p1, and if it is preceded by another value p0
 * which is also lesser than p1.
 *   First and last value of the value sequence are not considered peaks. If no
 * values are inserted, the program prints a dash character ('-') in lieu of
 * the two averages. If no peaks are detected, it prints a dash only for the
 * peaks average. */
